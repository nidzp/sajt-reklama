Prompt begins:

Codex, you are tasked with producing a complete, production-quality website for a fictional family-owned bakery named "Vespera Hearth Bakery," presented in a bilingual format (English and Serbian Latin) and styled with the immersive flair of a premier interactive entertainment launch site. The aesthetic should draw inspiration from the bold atmosphere of contemporary AAA promotional pages while remaining entirely original: do not copy, reference, or remix any Rockstar Games intellectual property. Deliver handcrafted HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that embody a neon-infused, purple-dominant palette, rich animations, and polished responsiveness suitable for both desktop and mobile visitors.

Maintain strict originality across all copy, component naming, and assets. Every textual element must be freshly authored, conveying a narrative of heritage, artisanal craft, and modern flair. The English and Serbian versions should be parallel in meaning yet naturally phrased for each language. Use Serbian Latin script without diacritics (for example, "Tradicija pecenja") to ensure broad font compatibility. Provide descriptive alt text for every image; populate image sources with organized placeholders located within an assets/img/ directory (for example, assets/img/sourdough.jpg). Clearly comment where the end user should substitute royalty-free imagery sourced from platforms such as Unsplash or Pexels, but do not embed external hotlinks in the final markup.

Adopt a sleek information architecture that supports intuitive scrolling and anchored navigation. Implement a fixed header that houses the bakery wordmark on the left and navigation links on the right, alongside a conspicuous language selector rendered as a compact toggle (EN / SR). The navigation should include anchors for "Home," "Story," "Specialties," "Gallery," and "Visit." Ensure the header transitions gracefully: begin transparent atop the hero banner, then assume a semi-opaque backdrop once the user scrolls past the hero section. On screens below 992px width, convert the navigation into an animated hamburger menu that expands vertically; position the language switch within the mobile panel for consistent discoverability.

Craft a dramatic hero section that spans the initial viewport height and layers a tinted, slow-moving video or image background, preferably a looping montage of baking visuals replaced by the developer later. Position the primary English headline "Vespera Hearth Bakery" and Serbian counterpart "Pekara Vespera Ognjiste" within semantic markup (such as an h1 and span with data-i18n) so they can swap cleanly on toggle. Accompany with dual-language taglines, such as "Where heritage rises daily" and "Mesto gde tradicija svakog jutra narasta," plus a succinct call-to-action button that scrolls to the specialties section. Animate the text sequentially (for example, fade and slide) for impact, and add a subtle down-arrow prompt encouraging exploration.

Dedicate the next segment to the bakery story, blending atmospheric typography with text blocks that celebrate multigenerational craftsmanship. Use two or three short paragraphs per language, describing the founders, cherished recipes, and community legacy. Offset the narrative with an image or video placeholder framed by a glowing border that harmonizes with the purple signature color. Introduce scroll-triggered reveal effects so the text and media glide gently into view.

Follow with a specialties showcase presented as a responsive grid or carousel. Feature at least six hero items, mixing breads, pastries, cakes, and seasonal highlights. Each item card must include the product name in English and Serbian, a succinct gourmet description written in both languages, a quality indicator (for example, "48-hour ferment" or "Hand-glazed each morning"), and a representative placeholder image. Consider layering text over imagery via gradient scrims to preserve readability. On desktop, display three cards per row; collapse to two and then one as the viewport narrows. Include hover states that increase luminance, apply soft drop shadows, and optionally reveal additional flavor notes.

Construct an immersive gallery that invites users to explore the bakery ambience. Use a masonry-style or evenly spaced grid of at least eight thumbnails. Implement a JavaScript-driven lightbox: clicking any thumbnail should open a modal with a larger image, caption in both languages, and close controls. Ensure keyboard accessibility (Escape to close, tab-trappable buttons) and trap focus while the modal is open. Provide alt text describing what each scene depicts, such as "Freshly dusted croissants" or "Tek iz pecnice kroasani."

Develop a "Visit Us" section that merges practical information with a welcoming tone. Include a fictitious address, phone number, email (with mailto), and hours of operation, all presented in both languages. Embed a stylized map or placeholder image, and comment where to integrate Google Maps if desired. Add a contact form featuring Name, Email, and Message fields, with bilingual labels and helper text. Validate fields using HTML5 attributes and supplement with JavaScript checks that display custom error messaging tied to the selected language. On submission, prevent actual send and instead produce a console log or on-screen confirmation toast depending on language. Ensure form controls are large enough for touch input and meet accessibility guidelines.

Reserve the footer for reinforcing the brand. Present the bilingual bakery name, a copyright notice ("Copyright 2025 Vespera Hearth Bakery. All rights reserved." and "Copyright 2025 Pekara Vespera Ognjiste. Sva prava zadrzana."), and social icon links pointing to placeholder URLs. Include icons for Instagram and Facebook using inline SVG or a lightweight icon font; recolor them to match the purple scheme on hover.

Implement a preloader overlay that displays the bakery logomark (design a simplified icon such as a stylized loaf encircled by a flame motif) and either a progress animation or animated tagline. The preloader should cover the viewport until core assets are ready; fade it out smoothly once the load event fires. Provide fallback logic so users on weak connections are not trapped longer than three seconds by using a timeout to remove the overlay.

Engineer the multilingual system with meticulous structure. Within script.js, declare a translations object containing nested keys for each text element. Use data attributes (data-i18n) on HTML elements to map them to translation keys. On initialization, set the default language to English, then check localStorage for a stored preference and apply it if present. Provide a function setLanguage(lang) that updates document.documentElement.lang, iterates through each element with data-i18n, and replaces text content or placeholders accordingly. Ensure buttons, form placeholders, aria-labels, and validation messages are covered. When a user toggles language, update the UI instantly, store the preference, and adjust any directional classes if needed. Confirm that longer Serbian strings do not break layout; use flexible containers to accommodate text expansion.

Enhance interactivity with smooth scrolling anchored links, IntersectionObserver-based section highlighting, and gently animated background elements such as floating particle lights or radial gradients that pulse within the purple spectrum. Respect motion preferences by disabling non-essential animations when prefers-reduced-motion is true. Apply CSS variables to manage the color palette (for example, --bg-dark, --accent-purple, --accent-lilac, --text-light) and keep the styling cohesive. Use modern layout systems: flexbox for alignment within sections, CSS Grid for product cards and galleries. Employ media queries at breakpoints around 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px to adjust typography, spacing, and column counts.

Structure the project as follows: root index.html, accompanying styles/styles.css, scripts/script.js, and an assets directory containing img/ and optionally video/. Reference the CSS and JS with relative paths. In HTML, include meta charset="UTF-8", meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", and meta name="description" entries in both languages that update when the language switches. Load two complementary Google Fonts: one decorative display font for headings that supports Serbian Latin, and one clean sans-serif for body copy. Use preconnect optimization hints for fonts.

In CSS, comment section blocks clearly (for example, /* Hero */, /* Gallery */). Define base resets, set box-sizing to border-box, and establish a fluid typographic scale. Use backdrop-blur or translucent effects to evoke a glassy, next-gen feel. Provide fallback colors for gradients and ensure legibility with adequate contrast ratios. For the neon glow aesthetic, rely on layered text shadows and subtle outer glows rather than excessive drop shadows.

In script.js, wrap logic inside document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ...) to avoid race conditions. Create modular functions: initPreloader(), initLanguageToggle(), initNavigation(), initScrollEffects(), initGalleryLightbox(), initFormValidation(). Each function should be clearly commented and invoked from an init() routine. Use const and let appropriately, avoid polluting the global scope, and keep the code lint-friendly. When adding event listeners, clean up where necessary. For the lightbox, manage focus and aria-hidden attributes to maintain accessibility. For active navigation states, update classes as IntersectionObserver identifies the section in view.

Optimize performance by deferring non-critical scripts, compressing placeholder background assets where feasible, and using loading="lazy" for off-screen images. Include descriptive comments in HTML indicating where developers should substitute actual video files or integrate analytics, while keeping comments concise. 

Before concluding, ensure the entire site is cohesive: all text nodes exist in both languages, the color palette is consistent, animations elevate the experience without hindering usability, and the layout adapts gracefully across devices. The resulting deliverable should feel like a premium, bespoke digital showcase for a cherished bakery, meeting all functional and aesthetic directives in this brief.
